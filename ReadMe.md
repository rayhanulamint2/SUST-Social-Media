# 📌 Project Overview

**SUSTverse** is a full-stack platform built for the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) to create a connected, transparent, and interactive digital ecosystem. It centralizes event coordination, notice distribution, alumni networking, anonymous feedback, and 24/7 information access — all in one place.
