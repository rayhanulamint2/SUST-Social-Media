## üéØ Project Purpose

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

At SUST, communication and event management systems are currently disjointed and inefficient. Information is scattered across various social media platforms, physical notice boards, or informal student groups. This leads to:

- Missed opportunities for alumni-student interaction.
- No centralized complaint-handling mechanism.
- Communication gaps between administration and students.

These issues highlight the urgent need for a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform that can bring all stakeholders together and promote a cohesive university experience.
